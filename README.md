# AndroidAlarms
The features that your app must have are as follows:
1. Add a new, one-time or recursive (allow users to select) alarm for a specific date and time. The alarm should display the user defined message in the notification bar and the location where it was set. The user input should be the date and time that the alarm is set to and the user defined message.
2. Add a new, one-time alarm that goes off after a certain time from the time it is created (e.g. go off five minutes from now). The alarm should display the user defined message in the notification bar and the location where it was set. The user input should be the time after which it should fire, in days and minutes and the user defined message

Unlike Java, Android has built-in alarm management. Look at these tutorials:
